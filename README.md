# Overview
# 6 fun and useful plugins to add to your server
**Chunk Claim** - Lets users claim chunks so no one else can interact with blocks in that chunk
**Server Auth** - Sets a password that all users must enter when they log on - useful for cracked servers
**Chest Death** - When a player dies thier inventory is stored in a chest instead of being dropped on the ground

# Future Work

- Item 1 Add teams to Chunk Claim so members of teams can edit their teammates' chunks
- Item 2 Make Chest Death dependant on an item so it's not too strong in-game
- Item 3 Add a list of trusted users to Server Auth so they only need to enter the password once
